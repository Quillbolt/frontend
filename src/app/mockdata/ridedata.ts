        p1:'The ride experience lives up to the hype that starts riders in a freefall before racing them around a gravity-defying 360-degree loop, all visible to spectators thanks to AquaLoop’s translucent fiberglass. It’s a classic image that has become synonymous with the pinnacle of high thrill water slides.',

        p1:"Water parks boast slides with dozens of loops, incredible speeds and exhilarating drops. The tallest free-fall water slide on record is the 120-foot (37-meter) 'Summit Plummet' in Walt Disney World's Blizzard Beach. If you'd rather ride down on a raft, you can take a plunge on the similarly record-breaking Insane, an 11-story-tall water slide in Brazil [source: World Waterpark Association]. Whether you're on a mat, a raft or your bare skin, you're at the mercy of gravity as you make your way down -- and sometimes up -- the slippery slope",
        p2:"A water slide is like a wet roller coaster with no seat and no safety harness, and it uses the same principles a roller coaster does to work. In this article, we'll peek behind the scenes to find out what's involved in operating a water slide, from pumping the water to cleaning it after the ride. We'll also see how the pieces of a wate­r slide fit together and find out what keeps you from flying off into the air as you whip around corners.",
